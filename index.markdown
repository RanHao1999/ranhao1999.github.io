Welcome to my personal homepage! 
I am Hao Ran (冉豪), a graduate student at the [Mullard Space Science Laboratory, University College London](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/mssl). 
My supervisor is [Prof. Daniel Verscharen](https://verscharen.com).



My research interests include: plasma motions across the solar system, 
   solar magnetism and activities, solar-terrestrial relations and space weather, and space-based instrumentation development. 
My research is important to the comprehension of the influence that the Sun has on humans and our facilities in space and on the ground.



I obtained my Bachelor’s degree in 2021 from the School of Astronomy and Space Science, Nanjing University, under the supervision of [Prof. Yang Guo]([https://astronomy.nju.edu.cn/szll/jsmc/twxjs/20190826/i14899.html](https://astronomy.nju.edu.cn/szll/szgk/js/20190816/i13841.html)). 
My undergraduate thesis discussed the relationship between successive solar flares originating from the same active region and [SHARP parameters](http://jsoc.stanford.edu/doc/data/hmi/sharp/sharp.htm).
Afterward, I pursued a master’s degree in Space Physics at the National Space Science Center, Chinese Academy of Sciences and graduated in 2024. My master's supervisor was [Prof. Ying Liu](https://people.ucas.edu.cn/~liuxying).
I analyzed the properties and characteristics of the alpha-proton differential flow in the near-Sun environment observed by [*Parker Solar Probe*](https://science.nasa.gov/mission/parker-solar-probe/) in my master's thesis.

I am from Guiyang, a city located in Southwestern China. I am a huge fan of soccer, F1, and any thrilling sports you can name. 
I also have a driver’s license allowing me to ride motorbikes in China. 
Chase the wind together!
I engage in photography, although still at an amateur level. 
I also enjoy playing computer games.

I am always happy to discuss science and collaborate with people.
Please feel free to contact me if you are interested in my work or have any questions regarding my research.
