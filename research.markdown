## The Alpha-proton Differetial Flow in the Young Solar Wind: From Sub-Alfvénic to Super-Alfvénic  
**Authors:** Hao Ran, Ying D. Liu, Chong Chen, Parisa Mostafavi  
**Published in:** *The Astrophysical Journal*, 963, 82, 2024    
**Abstract:** Data obtained from Parker Solar Probe (PSP) since 2021 April have shown the first in situ observation of the solar
corona, where the solar wind is formed and accelerated. Here, we investigate the alpha-proton differential flow and
its characteristics across the critical Alfvén surface (CAS) using data from PSP during encounters 8–10 and 12–13.
We first show the positive correlation between the alpha-proton differential velocity and the bulk solar wind speed
at PSP encounter distances. Then we explore how the characteristics of the differential flow vary across the CAS
and how they are affected by Alfvénic fluctuations including switchbacks. We find that the differential velocity
below the CAS is generally smaller than that above the CAS, and the local Alfvén speed well limits the differential
speed both above and below the CAS. The deviations from the alignment between the differential velocity and the
local magnetic field vector are accompanied by large-amplitude Alfvénic fluctuations and decreases in the
differential speed. Moreover, we observe that Vαp increases from MA < 1 to MA ~ 2 and then starts to decrease,
which suggests that alphas may remain preferentially accelerated well above the CAS. Our results also reveal that
in the sub-Alfvénic solar wind both protons and alphas show a strong correlation between their velocity
fluctuations and magnetic field fluctuations, with a weaker correlation for alphas. By contrast, in the super-Alfvénic
regime the correlation remains high for protons, but is reduced for alphas.

## Relationship between Successive Flares in the Same Active Region and SHARP Parameters   
**Authors:** Hao Ran, Ying D. Liu, Yang Guo, Rui Wang   
**Published in:** *The Astrophysical Journal*, 937, 43, 2022   
**Abstract:** A solar active region (AR) may produce multiple notable flares during its passage across the solar disk. We
investigate successive flares from flare-eruptive ARs, and explore their relationship with solar magnetic
parameters. We examine six ARs in this study, each with at least one major flare above X1.0. The Space-weather
HMI Active Region Patch (SHARP) is employed in this study to parameterize the ARs. We aim to identify the
most flare-related SHARP parameters and lay foundation for future practical flare forecasts. We first evaluate the
correlation coefficients between the SHARP parameters and the successive flare production. Then we adopt a
Natural Gradient Boost (NGBoost) method to analyze the relationship between the SHARP parameters and the
successive flare bursts. Based on the correlation analysis and the importance distribution returned from NGBoost,
we select the eight most flare-related SHARP parameters. Finally, we discuss the physical meanings of the eight
selected parameters and their relationship with flare production.
